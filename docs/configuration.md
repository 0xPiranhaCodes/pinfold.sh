# Configuration

Pinfold reads one TOML file at startup, on Linux and macOS alike:
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pinfold/pinfold.toml`, or `~/.config/pinfold/pinfold.toml` when that
variable is unset. Saving the file applies it to the running window within about a second.

| Key                   | Type   | Default | Meaning                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `font_size`           | number | `13`    | In points, from 6 to 72                                  |
| `font_path`           | string | none    | Absolute path to a monospace font file to use            |
| `macos_option_as_alt` | bool   | `false` | Option sends Alt instead of composing text. macOS only   |

```toml
font_size = 14
font_path = "/System/Library/Fonts/Menlo.ttc"
macos_option_as_alt = true
```

`font_path` takes a TrueType or OpenType file, or the first font in a collection. Pinfold
draws bold and italic by thickening and slanting that one font, not from separate files, and
without `font_path` it uses the bundled JetBrains Mono. A font file is treated as untrusted:
if it cannot be read, is damaged, or cannot draw all of ASCII, Pinfold prints why to stderr
and uses the bundled font. `~` is not expanded.

Every key is optional. Pinfold always opens: if the file has a problem, it prints why to
stderr and uses the defaults for every key. That covers an unknown key or a bad value
(named with its line), a file that is not UTF-8 or is over 64 KiB, a directory in the
file's place, a file it cannot read, and a file that another user owns or that group or
others can write (the rule from the threat model). A symlink is followed, and those
checks apply to its target.

## Reload

Every key applies on save, with no restart. The window keeps its size, so a new font or font
size changes how many rows and columns fit, and programs get a resize. Editors that write the
file in place and editors that save by rename both work, and so does a symlink.

A save gets the same checks as startup. If it has any of the problems above, Pinfold prints
why to stderr, once, and keeps the current settings rather than the defaults, until a later
save or `chmod` fixes it. A bad `font_path` file means the bundled font, as it does at startup.
Deleting the file changes nothing until the next start.

Pinfold checks the file with one `stat` a second on a thread of its own, so an idle window
wakes once a second for this. Changes to the font file itself are not noticed.
